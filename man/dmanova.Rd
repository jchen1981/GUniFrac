\title{Distance-based Multivariate Analysis of Variance (Analytical P-value Calculation)}

\description{Analysis of variance using distance matrices --- for
  partitioning distance matrices among sources of variation and fitting
  linear models (e.g., factors, polynomial regression) to distance 
  matrices; calculate the analytical p-value based on pseudo-\eqn{F} statistic 
  without permutation.}

\usage{
dmanova(formula, data = NULL, positify = FALSE,
		approx.method = c('HBE', 'Chisq', 'Adaptive'),
		HBE.is.sample = FALSE,  HBE.sample.no = 1000, 
		contr.unordered = "contr.sum", contr.ordered = "contr.poly", 
		returnG = FALSE)
}


		
\arguments{

  \item{formula}{model formula. The LHS must be a dissimilarity matrix (either class \code{matrix} or class
  \code{dist}, e.g., from  \code{\link{vegdist}} or \code{\link{dist}}.  The RHS defines the independent 
  variables. These can be continuous variables or factors, they can be transformed
    within the formula, and they can have interactions as in a typical
    \code{\link{formula}}. }

  \item{data}{the data frame for the independent variables.}
  \item{positify}{a logical value indicating whether to make the Gower's matrix  positive definite
   using the \code{\link{nearPD}} function in \code{Matrix} package. This is equivalent to modifying the distance 
   matrix so that it has an Euclidean embedding. }
  \item{approx.method}{the approximation method used.  'Chisq' - Chi-square approximation;
  'HBE' - Hall-Buckley-Eagleson approximation; Adaptive - first use 'Chisq' and if p value
  is less than 0.05, 'HBE' is used.  'HBE is more accurate but computationally more intensive.}
  \item{HBE.is.sample}{ a logical value indicating whether subsampling should be used to reduce the 
  computational cost for 'HBE'. Recommend using it when the sample size is very large (e.g. > 1000).}
  \item{HBE.sample.no}{the number of samples to be subsampled if 'HBE.is.sample' is true.}
    \item{contr.unordered, contr.ordered}{contrasts used for the design
    matrix (default in R is dummy or treatment contrasts for unordered
    factors). }
   \item{returnG}{a logical value indicating whether the Gower's matrix should be returned.}
}

\details{

\code{dmanova} is a permutation-free method for approximating the p-value from  distance-based permutational multivariate
analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). PERMANOVA is  slow when the sample size is large or there are a large number of tests. In contrast,
\code{dmanova} provides an analytical solution, which is several orders of magnitude faster for large sample sizes. The covariate of interest
should be put as the last term in \code{formula} while the variables to be adjusted are put before the covariate of interest.
}

\value{


  Function \code{dmanova} returns a list with the following components:

  \item{aov.tab}{typical AOV table showing sources of variation,
    degrees of freedom,  sums of squares, mean squares,
    \eqn{F} statistics, partial \eqn{R^2}{R-squared} and \eqn{P}
    values. }
  \item{df}{degree of freedom for the Chisquared distribution.} 
  \item{G}{ The Gower's matrix if \code{returnG} is true.}   
  \item{call}{ the call made}
